          description: |
            This is an automatically created issue used to list automatically created 
            javascript pull requests every 3 months.\n
            \n
            It was created by the `.github/workflows/js-prs-issue.yml` workflow in the [silverstripe/.github](https://github.com/silverstripe/.github/) repository.\n
            \n
            ### Triage instructions (Silverstripe Ltd CMS Squad)\n

               - `type/enhancement`\n
               - `impact/low`\n
               - `affects/v5`\n
            2. Move this issue to the "Ready" column on our internal zenhub board\n

            ### Update JS pull-requests:\n
            - [List of update JS pull-requests](https://emtek.net.nz/rhino/tables?t=open-prs&filters={%22title%22%3A%22DEP%20Update%20JS%20dependencies%22})\n
            - Merge these PRs if there are no merge-conflicts\n
            - If there are merge conflicts in some PRs, then manually run the "Update JS" github action in the 
              affected module. The github action will automatically close the old PR and delete the old branch.
            - If the new PRs still have merge conflicts, then close those PRs and run the steps below in the 
              "Manually creating update JS pull-requests" section below for those relevant modules\n
            \n
            ### Manually creating update JS pull-requests:\n
            1. Ensure you have the default branch checked out for the module you are updating e.g. `5`\n
            2. Ensure `silverstripe/silverstripe-admin` is installed in a *sibling* directory\n
            3. In the `silverstripe-admin` directory, ensure the default branch is checked out e.g. `2`\n
            4. In the `silverstripe-admin` directory, run `yarn install`\n
            5. In the directory of module you're updating JS for, run `yarn upgrade`\n
            6. Run `yarn build` in the directory of module you're updating JS for\n
            7. Git commit, push the changes and create a pull-request\n
            8. List the pull-request(s) on this issue\n
            9. Move this issue to the peer review column on the CMS Squad internal zenhub board\n
            \n
            ### Dependabot pull-requests:\n
            - [List of dependabot pull-requests](https://emtek.net.nz/rhino/tables?t=open-prs&filters={%22author%22%3A%22dependabot%22})\n
            - Most of these should be automatically closed if the "Update JS pull-requests" above are merged\n
            - You can make a judgement call as to whether to merge any easy ones that are left\n
            \n
            ### Dependabot alerts:\n
            After all of the above have been completed and resolved, check for any outstanding dependabot alerts:\n
            ${{ env.ALERTS_LIST }}

      - name: Delete temporary files
        shell: bash
        if: always()
        run: |
          if [[ -f __modules.json ]]; then
            rm __modules.json
          fi
