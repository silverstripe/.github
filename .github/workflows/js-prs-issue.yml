            - [List of update JS pull-requests](https://rhino.silverstripe.org/?t=open-prs&filters={%22title%22%3A%22DEP%20Update%20JS%20dependencies%22})\n
            - Merge these PRs if there are no merge-conflicts\n
            - If there are merge conflicts in some PRs, then manually run the "Update JS" github action in the 
              affected module. The github action will automatically close the old PR and delete the old branch.
            - If the new PRs still have merge conflicts, then close those PRs and run the steps below in the 
              "Manually creating update JS pull-requests" section below for those relevant modules\n
            \n
            ### Manually creating update JS pull-requests:\n
            1. Ensure you have the default branch checked out for the module you are updating e.g. `5`\n
            2. Ensure `silverstripe/silverstripe-admin` is installed in a *sibling* directory\n
            3. In the `silverstripe-admin` directory, ensure the default branch is checked out e.g. `2`\n
            4. In the `silverstripe-admin` directory, run `yarn install`\n
            5. In the directory of module you're updating JS for, run `yarn upgrade`\n
            6. Run `yarn build` in the directory of module you're updating JS for\n
            7. Git commit, push the changes and create a pull-request\n
