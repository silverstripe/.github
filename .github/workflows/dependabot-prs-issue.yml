          description: |
            This is an automatically created issue used to list dependabot pull requests every 3 months.\n
            \n
            It was created by the `.github/workflows/dependabot-prs-issue.yml` workflow in the [silverstripe/.github](https://github.com/silverstripe/.github/) repository.\n
            \n
            ### Triage instructions (Silverstripe Ltd CMS Squad)\n
            1. Put on the following labels:\n
               - `type/bug`\n
               - `impact/low`\n
            2. Move this issue to the "Ready" column on our internal zenhub board\n
            3. If there is an open issue for JS PRs, block this issue on it - those PRs may resolve some dependabot alerts\n
            \n
            ### Dependabot pull-requests:\n
            See the [list of dependabot pull-requests](https://rhino.silverstripe.org/?t=open-prs&filters={%22author%22%3A%22dependabot%22}) in Rhino.\n
            - Make a quick determination as to whether the vulnerability fixed by the PR warrants using our security process\n
              - You can check to see if the dependabot alert affects non-dev dependencies by running `yarn audit --groups dependencies` locally on default branch of the module.\n
              - Use `yarn audit --groups devDependencies` to see dev-only dependencies.\n
            - Merge these PRs if there are no merge-conflicts and CI is green\n
            - If there are conflicts or CI isn't green, get dependabot to recreate the PR\n
            - If there are still problems, manually resolve them and open your own PR\n
            - Backport anything that seems like it needs to be patched immediately\n
            \n
            ### Dependabot alerts:\n
            After all of the above have been completed and resolved, check for any outstanding dependabot alerts in the list below.\n
            - Make a quick determination as to whether any alerts warrant using our security process\n
            - Ignore or dismiss any alerts that aren't relevant\n
            - Try to resolve any relevant alerts which dependabot is unable to resolve automatically\n
            \n
            Respositories with alerts:\n
