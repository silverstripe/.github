## Security triage

Core Committers are allowed access to the private GitHub organisation where security issues are raised and discussed, and where security patches are held until they're ready for release.

- [Managing security issues](https://docs.silverstripe.org/en/contributing/managing_security_issues/)

If you want access to the security please read the documentation listed above, update the date next to your name in the table below, and ensure "wants access" has a "yes".

Core Committers who don't update this table within a year will have their access revoked until they update it.
